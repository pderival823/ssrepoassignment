My Project is a powerpoint presentation from a previous class where I spoke about Guassian Elimination in relation to Electrical Engineering ideas and concepts. I am paticularyly proud of this presentation because I was able to talk about the relation between 2 pretty advanced concepts that I leanred in 2 different class subjects(Linear Algebra & Engineering Physics).
